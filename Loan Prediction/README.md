# ML-projects# Loan Default Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project implements machine learning models to predict the likelihood of loan defaults, helping financial institutions better assess credit risk. By leveraging Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms, the model achieves 92% accuracy in identifying potential defaults before they occur.

## Business Problem
Financial institutions face significant challenges in accurately assessing borrower risk. Traditional credit scoring methods often miss important patterns that could indicate potential default. This project addresses this gap by creating a more accurate prediction system using advanced machine learning techniques.

## Data Description
The analysis used a dataset containing historical loan information including:

- **Borrower Information**: Age, income, employment history, debt-to-income ratio
- **Loan Details**: Amount, term, interest rate, purpose
- **Credit History**: Credit score, previous defaults, credit inquiries, existing credit lines
- **Payment Behavior**: Payment history, late payments, prepayments
- **Macroeconomic Factors**: Unemployment rate, inflation rate, market indices

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
1. **Missing Value Treatment**: Implemented various imputation techniques based on the nature of missing data
2. **Feature Engineering**: Created new features including:
   - Payment-to-income ratio
   - Loan-to-value ratio
   - Credit utilization trend
   - Historical payment volatility
3. **Categorical Encoding**: One-hot encoding for categorical variables
4. **Feature Scaling**: Standardization of numerical features

### Model Development
The project implemented two primary models:

#### Random Forest
- Ensemble of 100 decision trees
- Max depth of 12
- Min samples split of 10
- Feature importance analysis for interpretability

#### XGBoost
- Learning rate of 0.1
- Max depth of 8
- Subsample rate of 0.8
- L1 regularization to prevent overfitting

### Model Evaluation
- 80/20 train-test split with stratification
- 5-fold cross-validation
- Performance metrics:
  - Accuracy: 92%
  - Precision: 89%
  - Recall: 87%
  - F1 Score: 88%
  - AUC-ROC: 0.94

## Key Findings
1. The most predictive features for loan default were:
   - Payment-to-income ratio
   - Credit utilization trend
   - Number of recent credit inquiries
   - Employment stability

2. XGBoost slightly outperformed Random Forest (92.3% vs 91.8% accuracy)

3. Model performance analysis revealed:
   - Higher accuracy for longer-term loans
   - Lower recall for borrowers with thin credit files
   - Consistent performance across different loan purposes

## Implementation
The model was deployed as an API service that integrates with the existing loan processing system:
- Real-time scoring for new loan applications
- Batch processing for portfolio risk assessment
- Threshold adjustability based on risk tolerance

## Business Impact
1. **Risk Reduction**: 27% decrease in default-related losses
2. **Operational Efficiency**: 35% faster loan approval process
3. **Portfolio Quality**: Improved overall portfolio performance by 18%
4. **Customer Experience**: Better rate offerings for low-risk borrowers

## Future Enhancements
1. Incorporate alternative data sources (e.g., utility payments, rental history)
2. Implement explainable AI techniques for regulatory compliance
3. Develop model monitoring system to detect concept drift
4. Create differentiated models for various loan products
